//Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:  

//The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
//The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
//The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. 
//There must be no duplicate nodes.
//Illustration to insert 
//1.Start from the root.
//2.Compare the inserting element with root, if less than root, then recurse for left, else recurse for right. 
//3. After reaching the end, just insert that node at left(if less than current) else right.
